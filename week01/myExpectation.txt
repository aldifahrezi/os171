I expect to learn about how operating systems work, and how I can apply that knowledge to my daily life (scripting will help a lot).
I also expect to learn about the Linux kernel and the newest software often used in Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) such as systemd init service.
Mostly things that are useful for DevOps or IT Operations.
